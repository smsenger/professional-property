        <p class="name"><strong>Saesha Senger, PhD</strong></p>
        <p class="description"><strong>This dissertation explores issues of gender politics, market segmentation, and taste through an examination of the 
            contributions of several artists who have achieved Adult Contemporary (AC) chart success.</strong> The scope of the project 
            is limited to a period when many artists who figured prominently in both the broader mainstream of American popular 
            music and the more specific Adult Contemporary category were most commercially viable: from the mid-1980s through 
            the 1990s. My contention is that, as gender politics and gendered social norms continued to change in the United 
            States at this time, Adult Contemporary – the chart, the format, and the associated music – was an important, 
            if overlooked or even trivialized, arena in which these shifting gender dynamics played out. This dissertation 
            explores the significance of the Adult Contemporary format at the end of the twentieth century through analysis 
            of chart performance, artist image, musical works, marketing, and contextual factors. By documenting these relevant 
            social, political, economic, and musical factors, the notable role of a format and of artists neglected by scholars 
            becomes clear.</p>
